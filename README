    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>This project involves adding custom system calls to a Linux kernel as part of UMBC CMSC 421. In Part 1, a new syscall called <code>hello</code> was implemented, which logs "Hello World!" in the kernel log. In Part 2, a new syscall called <code>data_copy</code> will be implemented to copy data between user space and kernel space.</p>

    <h2>What’s Implemented</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Custom kernel built and installed.</li>
        <li><code>hello</code> syscall: Prints "Hello World!" to kernel log.</li>
        <li>User-space test program calls the syscall and checks <code>dmesg</code>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Test</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Boot into the custom kernel via GRUB.</li>
        <li>Compile the user-space test program:
            <pre>
gcc hello_syscall.c -o hello_syscall
./hello_syscall
            </pre>
        </li>
        <li>Check <code>dmesg</code> for "Hello World!"</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Implement the <code>data_copy</code> syscall as described in Part 4.</li>
        <li>Add clear error handling for invalid user pointers.</li>
        <li>Write a user-space program to test <code>data_copy</code>.</li>
    </ul>

Linux kernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
