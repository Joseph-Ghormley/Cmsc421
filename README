## Project Overview
This project involves adding custom system calls to a Linux kernel as part of UMBC CMSC 421. In Part 1, a new syscall called `hello` was implemented, which logs "Hello World!" in the kernel log. In Part 2, a new syscall called `data_copy` will be implemented to copy data between user space and kernel space.

## What’s Implemented
- Custom kernel built and installed.
- `hello` syscall: Prints "Hello World!" to the kernel log.
- User-space test program calls the syscall and checks `dmesg`.

## How to Test
1. Boot into the custom kernel via GRUB.
2. Compile the user-space test program:
   ```bash
   gcc hello_syscall.c -o hello_syscall
   ./hello_syscall








Linux kernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
